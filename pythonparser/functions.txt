TON(timer_name,preset,accumulation)
preset - threshold     timer_name.pre (integer in milliseconds)
accumulation - counter timer_name.acc (integer in milliseconds)
DN will go from 0 to 1 when acc >= pre (binary)
TT will have the opposite value of DN (binary)
EN will stay on for the preset time after input turns on and until input goes low
acc will not reset until input goes back and then high again 
DN and TT and EN are most important



ADD(a,b,c)
c = a+b
all three can be constants or memory variables
all integers (for now at least)



MOV(a,b)
b = a
